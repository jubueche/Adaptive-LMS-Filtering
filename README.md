# Adaptive-LMS-Filtering
This repository also includes a matlab version of the lms algorithm (more comments) and a version of delta learning using the bipolar sigmoid function.
See the pdf file for convergence proofs for LMS and NLMS (normalized). These proofs show that for a given step size, convergence is guaranteed.
